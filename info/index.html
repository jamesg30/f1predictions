Important to note, if more than one team reports the same team in the same round, that teams highest scoring driver will instead score double points.

                    <div class="mb-3 pixel-art-heading-2">What is the individual competition?</div>
                    The individual competition involves predicting various questions and submitting the predictions <b>before</b> the race starts through the form (hence the URL).<br>
                    The form is released after qualifying. Last season, this would typically be around 3-4pm for the typical 11pm race (Melbourne Time)<br>
                    Each race will feature:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Top 6 Predictions</li>
                        <li>10 random questions (typically 5 yes/no)</li>
                        <li>Winning Margin Prediction</li>
                    </ul>
                    The individual competition will remain <b>unchanged</b> from previous years. I have no plans to change the individual format.<br>
                    In some races, there may be one or two extra questions in the middle section. Typically, the last race will have many more questions. Please read both the Form Rules and Card Rules tab to understand all the scoring details
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <div class="mb-3 pixel-art-heading-2">What is the teams competition?</div>
                    New for the 2025 season, there is now a team championship!<br>
                    Players will now be able to create teams, with one other player (teams of max size 2). As a basic concept, the scores of both players will be combined each week (as in F1) to form our teams championship.
                    However, simply adding the scores would probably prove rather uninteresting.<br>
                    There are 5 cards (read the Card Rules tab) which will help to add some twists to the team championship, and additionally Casino rounds to reward (or penalise) more daring players! All Casino rounds/cards will need to be submitted <b>before</b> the race, alongside the regular forms.

                    <div class="mb-3 pixel-art-heading-2">What is the new login system?</div>
                    To ensure the form is secured, users are made to login before any forms can be submitted.<br>
                    Users submit a PIN upon registering, which will be used to log in. These PIN's are secured with encryption.<br>
                    Users can log in by pressing the button in the MENU. A small icon with the first letter of their name will be displayed to indicate they are logged in.<br>
                    When logging in, users can select 'remember me', which will set the cookie to be saved for 30 days<br>
                    The new system has many benefits for users<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All name and team fields will be automatically populated</li>
                        <li>The main form will populate with your previous predictions, making edits much easier</li>
                        <li>Card and casino pages will also populate with existing submissions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="mb-3 pixel-art-heading-2">What is the submision/results/scoring process?</div>
                    The form will be posted after qualifying is completed. Typically, F1 races are on Sunday evening Australia time, and in these case the form will aim to be released by 3pm. In other cases, please check the page, it will be uploaded as soon as possible.
                    <br>
                    The form/team cards will <b>close on the hour when the race starts</b>! i.e. If the race starts at 11pm, the form/team cards will no longer accept responses at this time. This is different to previous years where there was a small amount of flexibility, the process is now automated and <b>there is a hard cut-off</b>
                    <br>
                    Results will be released as soon as practical (often races finish in the middle of the night, or waiting on websites being updated to see fastest pit stops etc.). The results and scoring process is completely automated. Results can be viewed for all of the races in the 'Results' tab, as well as the season summaries. If any issues are noticed, please fill out the feedback page and they will be investigated.

                    These rounds occur during the Monaco and Las Vegas GP. During these rounds, no cards can be played.<br>
                    In these rounds, the Casino will open instead of the card playing form. In the casino, you can bet some of your teams points on different questions, each with different odds. 
                    e.g. Lance Stroll finishes on the podium: odds 10:1<br>
                    There will be 3 questions, and each one can have up to either 5 or 10 points bet on it.

                    <div class="mb-3 pixel-art-heading-2">Can you earn more cards throughout the season?</div>
                    No, the cards you get at the start will be all you get for the season.<br>
                    However, to encourage closer competition, at the mid-year break I plan to issue bonus cards to lower-scoring teams. The current plan is:<br>
                    2nd last - +1 halo<br>
                    Last - +1 halo, +1 aero
